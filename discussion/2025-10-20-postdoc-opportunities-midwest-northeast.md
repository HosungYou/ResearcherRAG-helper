## Research Proposal Angles

### How to Pitch ScholaRAG in Postdoc Applications

**For Business Schools (Booth, Kellogg, Tepper):**

> **Title**: "AI's Impact on Knowledge Work Productivity: Evidence from Systematic Literature Reviews"
>
> **Research Question**: How do AI-powered tools transform high-skill knowledge work, and what are the implications for workforce development and organizational strategy?
>
> **Approach**: Use ScholaRAG as a case study of AI-human collaboration in research-intensive tasks. Measure productivity gains, skill transformation, and quality trade-offs when researchers use AI agents vs. traditional methods.
>
> **Business Relevance**: Systematic reviews = knowledge synthesis (analogous to consulting, market research, competitive intelligence). Findings generalize to other knowledge work contexts.

**For AI/Data Science Programs (DSI, MIDAS, CMU):**

> **Title**: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Scientific Literature Synthesis"
>
> **Research Question**: How can RAG systems be designed to support transparent, reproducible, and high-quality systematic literature reviews?
>
> **Approach**: Develop and evaluate ScholaRAG's AI-PRISMA methodology. Compare AI-assisted vs. manual screening. Study hallucination detection, evidence grounding, and human-AI validation.
>
> **AI Innovation**: Novel rubric-based evaluation, confidence-based routing, and transparency mechanisms for research AI.

**For Education/Learning Sciences:**

> **Title**: "Teaching Research Methods in the Age of AI: The ScholaRAG Codebook Approach"
>
> **Research Question**: How can AI-powered research tools serve dual purposes as both productivity tools and educational platforms?
>
> **Approach**: Evaluate ScholaRAG codebook's effectiveness in teaching systematic review methods, RAG concepts, and prompt engineering to graduate students.
>
> **Educational Innovation**: Platform-embedded learning, transparent AI processes, and dual-mode design (research + education).

## Penn State vs. Top Programs Comparison

### Why Consider Moving from Penn State?

**Pros of Midwest/Northeast Programs:**

1. **Business School Integration**
   - Georgetown, Chicago Booth, Kellogg = top business schools
   - Direct collaboration with business faculty
   - Better positioning for ScholaRAG commercialization research

2. **AI Prestige**
   - CMU = #1 AI globally
   - UChicago, UMichigan, Northwestern = top 10 data science
   - Stronger AI research communities than Penn State

3. **Geographic Networks**
   - Chicago: 2 top universities (UChicago, Northwestern) for collaboration
   - D.C.: Policy connections (NSF, NIH, Dept of Education)
   - Pittsburgh: CMU + industry (Bosch, Google AI)

4. **Career Positioning**
   - Top-tier postdoc → better faculty job market outcomes
   - "Postdoc at Chicago Booth" > "Postdoc at Penn State"

**Cons (Why Stay at Penn State?):**

1. **Existing Relationships**
   - Rick Rhoades collaboration established
   - Penn State infrastructure access (ICDS)
   - Current advisor connections

2. **ScholaRAG Integration**
   - Already pitched to Penn State
   - "Developed at Penn State" branding started

3. **Cost of Living**
   - State College < Chicago/D.C./Pittsburgh
   - Postdoc salaries may not stretch as far

4. **Flexibility**
   - Penn State might allow more independence
   - Established postdocs may have rigid research agendas

**Recommendation**: **Apply to top programs, but negotiate with Penn State**

- Use external offers as leverage
- Ask Penn State to match salary, resources
- Propose hybrid: Penn State affiliation + visiting scholar at Chicago/Northwestern

---

## Questions to Ask Programs

### During Application/Interview:

1. **Mentorship Structure:**
   - Who would be my primary mentor?
   - Can I work with faculty across departments (e.g., Business + CS)?
   - How much independence do postdocs have?

2. **Resources:**
   - Funding for conferences, travel, research expenses?
   - Access to compute resources (GPUs for AI experiments)?
   - Can I supervise students (RAs, master's students)?

3. **Career Support:**
   - What percentage of postdocs get faculty positions?
   - Do you help with academic job market preparation?
   - Can I teach a course (for faculty job experience)?

4. **Publication Expectations:**
   - How many publications expected in 2 years?
   - Support for conference travel (AERA, AOM, CHI)?
   - Co-authorship norms with mentors?

5. **Commercialization:**
   - Can I continue developing ScholaRAG commercially?
   - IP ownership if I use university resources?
