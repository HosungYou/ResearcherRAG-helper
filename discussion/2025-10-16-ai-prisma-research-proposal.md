**Principal Investigator**: Hosung You
**Institution**: Penn State University
**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Research Domain**: Research Methodology, AI-Assisted Literature Review, Information Science

---

## Executive Summary

This research proposes to establish the **academic validity and methodological rigor** of AI-assisted PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) through:

1. **Dual Research Objectives**:
   - Literature Review: Comprehensive systematic review demonstrating ScholarRAG methodology
   - Methodological Innovation: Development and validation of AI-specific PRISMA metrics

2. **Core Innovation**:
   - AI can process literature with **human-level granularity** without time constraints
   - New screening stages impossible for human reviewers (due to time/cost)
   - Transparent, reproducible, and validatable AI decision-making

3. **Expected Impact**:
   - Peer-reviewed validation framework for AI-assisted systematic reviews
   - Open-source tool adoption by research community
   - New standards for AI transparency in research synthesis

---

## 1. Research Context & Motivation

### 1.1 The Systematic Review Crisis

**Current State**:
- Traditional systematic reviews take **6-12 months** (average)
- Cost: **$140,000-$200,000** per review (Cochrane estimates)
- Screening burden: 10,000+ abstracts → 50-100 included studies
- Human limitations:
  - Fatigue-induced inconsistency (Cohen's κ = 0.50-0.82)
  - Conservative screening (minimize false negatives → high workload)
  - Cannot process full-text at scale

**AI Opportunity**:
- Process time: **Hours to days** (not months)
- Cost: **$500-2,000** (API costs)
- Consistent decision-making (no fatigue)
- Can read full-text of ALL candidates (not just abstracts)
- Granular analysis impossible for humans (e.g., 10-stage screening)

### 1.2 Academic Skepticism & Trust Gap

**Barriers to AI Adoption**:
1. **Black Box Problem**: "How does AI make decisions?"
2. **Hallucination Concerns**: LLM factual reliability
3. **Reproducibility**: "Can others verify your results?"
4. **Journal Policies**: Many journals lack AI disclosure guidelines
5. **Methodological Standards**: No consensus on AI-PRISMA validation

**Our Response**: Radical transparency + rigorous validation

---

## 2. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective 1: Demonstrate AI-PRISMA Methodology

**Goal**: Conduct a high-quality systematic review using ScholarRAG, publishable in top-tier journals

**Research Question** (Example Domain):
> "What are the effects of AI-assisted instructional interventions on student learning outcomes in higher education? (2020-2025)"

**PRISMA Compliance**:
- ✅ Pre-registered protocol (OSF/PROSPERO)
- ✅ PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist
- ✅ PRISMA-AI extension (healthcare AI guidelines adapted)
- ✅ Full transparency (code, data, prompts)

**Outcome**: Peer-reviewed publication demonstrating feasibility and quality

---

### Primary Objective 2: Validate AI-Specific Metrics

**Goal**: Develop and validate new screening metrics that leverage AI capabilities

**Innovation**: Move beyond "AI as human replacement" → "AI as methodological expansion"

#### Traditional PRISMA (Human-Constrained):
```
Stage 1: Title/Abstract Screening (10,000 → 500)
Stage 2: Full-Text Screening (500 → 100)
Stage 3: Data Extraction (100 papers)
```

**Problem**: Humans can't deeply analyze 10,000 abstracts

#### AI-Enhanced PRISMA (Proposed):
```
Stage 1: Metadata Filtering (10,000 → 8,000)
Stage 2: Relevance Screening - Abstract (8,000 → 2,000)
Stage 3: Methodological Quality - Abstract (2,000 → 800)
Stage 4: Full-Text Retrieval (800 PDFs acquired)
Stage 5: Full-Text Relevance (800 → 400)
Stage 6: Full-Text Methodological Quality (400 → 200)
Stage 7: Data Completeness Check (200 → 150)
Stage 8: Bias Risk Assessment (150 papers)
Stage 9: Thematic Coding (150 papers, 10 themes)
Stage 10: Final Inclusion (150 → 100 high-quality papers)
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Traditional: Humans read 500 full-texts (realistic limit)
- AI-Enhanced: AI reads **800 full-texts**, applies **4 additional filters**
- Result: Higher precision, transparent decision trail

**Validation Approach**: Compare AI vs. Human on each stage (see Section 4)

---

### Secondary Objective: Missing Data Solutions

**Problem**: Metadata available, but PDFs behind paywalls

**Proposed Solutions**:

#### 1. Institutional Access Integration
```python
# ScholarRAG enhancement
def acquire_pdf(doi, metadata):
    # Try institutional proxy
    pdf = try_library_access(doi, institution='psu.edu')

    if pdf:
        return pdf
    else:
        # Human intervention workflow
        return request_human_download(doi, metadata)
```

**Workflow**:
1. ScholarRAG extracts metadata (DOI, title, authors)
2. Attempts automated PDF retrieval via institutional access
3. If fails → generates "Manual Download List" for researcher
4. Researcher uses institutional credentials to download
5. Uploads PDFs to ScholarRAG workspace
6. Process continues automatically

**Transparency**: Report in Methods section
```
"Of 800 candidate studies, 623 (77.9%) were automatically retrieved
via institutional access, and 177 (22.1%) required manual download
due to access restrictions. All PDFs were successfully acquired."
```

#### 2. Legal Open Access Prioritization
```python
# Preferentially include OA papers when quality is equal
screening_criteria = {
    'open_access_bonus': 0.1,  # Slight preference for OA
    'rationale': 'Enhances reproducibility'
}
```

**Justification**: Other researchers can verify your decisions if papers are openly accessible

---

## 3. Methodological Innovation: AI-Specific PRISMA Metrics

### 3.1 The Core Problem: AI Decision Opacity

**Traditional Validation** (Human Reviewers):
```
Reviewer A: Include
Reviewer B: Exclude
→ Disagreement recorded
→ Resolved by discussion or third reviewer
→ Cohen's κ = 0.82 (good agreement)
```

**AI Validation** (Current Approach):
```
AI: Include
Human: Include
→ Agreement recorded
→ Cohen's κ = 0.85
→ "AI is reliable"
```

**Problem**: We don't know **why** AI made that decision

### 3.2 Proposed Solution: Multi-Dimensional AI Metrics

#### Metric 1: Decision Confidence with Uncertainty Quantification

**Traditional**:
```
AI Decision: Include
```

**Enhanced**:
```
AI Decision: Include
Confidence: 87% (High)
Uncertainty Sources:
  - Abstract ambiguity: 8%
  - Methodological clarity: 5%
Reasoning: "Study clearly describes RCT design (confidence: 95%)
            and reports learning outcomes (confidence: 92%).
            Population matches inclusion criteria (confidence: 81%)."
```

**Validation**:
- Low confidence decisions (<70%) → Flag for human review
- Track calibration: Are 90% confidence decisions correct 90% of time?

**Implementation**:
```python
def screen_paper_with_confidence(paper, criteria):
    # Generate multiple LLM responses (n=5)
    decisions = []
    for i in range(5):
        result = llm.analyze(paper, criteria, temperature=0.7)
        decisions.append(result)

    # Measure consistency
    agreement_rate = calculate_agreement(decisions)

    # Extract reasoning
    reasoning = llm.explain_decision(paper, criteria, temperature=0.0)

    return {
        'decision': majority_vote(decisions),
        'confidence': agreement_rate,
        'reasoning': reasoning,
        'uncertainty': identify_ambiguities(decisions)
    }
```

**Reporting** (Supplementary Table):
```
| Stage | Total | High Conf (>80%) | Medium (60-80%) | Low (<60%) | Human Review |
|-------|-------|------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 2     | 8000  | 6400 (80%)       | 1200 (15%)      | 400 (5%)   | 400          |
| 3     | 2000  | 1700 (85%)       | 250 (12.5%)     | 50 (2.5%)  | 50           |
```

**Validation Study**: Do low-confidence AI decisions have higher human disagreement rate?

---

#### Metric 2: Granular Decision Criteria Tracking

**Problem**: "Include/Exclude" is binary, but decisions are multi-faceted

**Solution**: Track sub-criteria independently

**Example Inclusion Criteria**:
```yaml
inclusion_criteria:
  population:
    - "Higher education students (undergraduate or graduate)"
    - AI Score: 0-100 (0=clearly not, 100=perfect match)

  intervention:
    - "AI-assisted instructional intervention"
    - AI Score: 0-100

  outcomes:
    - "Learning outcomes (grades, knowledge gains, skills)"
    - AI Score: 0-100

  study_design:
    - "Empirical study with quantitative or qualitative data"
    - AI Score: 0-100
```

**AI Analysis**:
```json
{
  "paper_id": "Smith2023",
  "title": "Using ChatGPT in Programming Education",
  "sub_criteria_scores": {
    "population": 95,  // "undergraduate CS students"
    "intervention": 92, // "ChatGPT-assisted coding"
    "outcomes": 88,     // "exam scores and project quality"
    "study_design": 78  // "quasi-experimental, n=45"
  },
  "overall_score": 88.25,
  "decision": "Include",
  "reasoning": {
    "population": "Clearly states 'undergraduate CS students at Large State University'",
    "intervention": "Intervention is ChatGPT providing code hints during assignments",
    "outcomes": "Measured via midterm exam (quantitative) and project rubric",
    "study_design": "Quasi-experimental with control group, but no randomization (minor concern)"
  }
}
```

**Threshold Strategy**:
```python
# Include if ALL sub-criteria ≥ 70 AND overall ≥ 80
def determine_inclusion(scores):
    if min(scores.values()) >= 70 and mean(scores.values()) >= 80:
        return "Include"
    elif max(scores.values()) < 50:
        return "Exclude (clear mismatch)"
    else:
        return "Uncertain (human review)"
```

**Transparency Benefit**:
- Reviewers can see **exactly why** a paper was included/excluded
- Borderline cases are flagged (e.g., population=95, but study_design=65)
- Enables sensitivity analysis: "What if we lower study_design threshold to 60?"

**Validation**:
- Human reviewers independently score 100 papers on same sub-criteria
- Calculate Cohen's κ for each sub-criterion separately
- Compare AI score distributions to human distributions

---

#### Metric 3: Hallucination Detection & Fact-Grounding

**Problem**: LLMs may "hallucinate" facts not in the paper

**Example**:
```
AI Claim: "The study included 250 participants"
Actual Paper: "We recruited participants from three universities" (no N reported)
→ Hallucination detected
```

**Solution**: Citation-Level Fact Verification

**Implementation**:
```python
def verify_claim(claim, paper_text):
    # Ask LLM to cite specific text supporting the claim
    response = llm.generate(f"""
    Claim: {claim}

    Find the exact sentence in the paper that supports this claim.
    If no sentence supports it, respond "NOT FOUND".

    Paper:
    {paper_text}
    """)

    if response == "NOT FOUND":
        return {"verified": False, "hallucination": True}
    else:
        # Extract cited text
        citation = response.strip()

        # Verify citation exists in paper (exact match)
        if citation in paper_text:
            return {
                "verified": True,
                "citation": citation,
                "hallucination": False
            }
        else:
            return {
                "verified": False,
                "hallucination": True,
                "ai_claimed_citation": citation
            }
```

**Reporting**:
```
Data Extraction Verification:
- Total data points extracted: 1,247
- Verified with direct citations: 1,198 (96.1%)
- Unable to verify (data not in paper): 49 (3.9%)
  - Handled via: Marked as "Not Reported" in analysis
- Hallucinations detected: 0 (0%)
```

**Quality Check**:
- Randomly sample 100 extracted data points
- Human verifies citations
- Calculate precision: % of AI extractions that are correct

---

#### Metric 4: Inter-Stage Consistency Analysis

**Concept**: AI decisions should be logically consistent across screening stages

**Example Inconsistency**:
```
Stage 2 (Abstract): Include (Score: 95)
  Reasoning: "Perfect match for inclusion criteria"

Stage 5 (Full-Text): Exclude (Score: 40)
  Reasoning: "Study does not report learning outcomes"

→ Inconsistency: If abstract clearly indicated outcomes, why didn't full-text?
```

**Validation**:
```python
def detect_inconsistencies(paper_id):
    abstract_decision = get_decision(paper_id, stage=2)
    fulltext_decision = get_decision(paper_id, stage=5)

    if abstract_decision['score'] >= 80 and fulltext_decision['score'] < 60:
        # Investigate
        inconsistency = {
            'paper_id': paper_id,
            'abstract_reasoning': abstract_decision['reasoning'],
            'fulltext_reasoning': fulltext_decision['reasoning'],
            'discrepancy': 'High abstract score but low full-text score',
            'flag': 'Human review recommended'
        }
        return inconsistency
```

**Reporting**:
```
Consistency Analysis:
- Papers with consistent decisions (Stage 2 → Stage 5): 734/800 (91.8%)
- Papers with major discrepancies (score difference >30): 66/800 (8.3%)
  - Investigated: 66
  - Resolved: 60 (Abstract was misleading)
  - Human re-review: 6
```

**Benefit**: Catches LLM errors or genuinely misleading abstracts

---

#### Metric 5: Comparative Human Validation (Gold Standard)

**Gold Standard Design**:

**Phase 1: Calibration Set (n=100 papers)**
1. AI screens 100 papers (blind)
2. 3 Human experts screen same 100 papers (blind)
3. Calculate:
   - AI vs. Human 1: Cohen's κ
   - AI vs. Human 2: Cohen's κ
   - AI vs. Human 3: Cohen's κ
   - Human 1 vs. Human 2: Cohen's κ (baseline)
   - Human 1 vs. Human 3: Cohen's κ (baseline)
   - Human 2 vs. Human 3: Cohen's κ (baseline)

**Interpretation**:
```
Results:
AI vs. Humans: κ = 0.84 (average)
Human vs. Human: κ = 0.79 (average)

→ Conclusion: AI reliability exceeds human inter-rater reliability
```

**Phase 2: Sensitivity Analysis (n=50 papers)**
1. Select 50 borderline cases (AI confidence 60-75%)
2. All 3 humans + AI screen
3. Analyze disagreement patterns

**Phase 3: Full-Text Deep Validation (n=20 papers)**
1. Humans extract same data points as AI
2. Compare:
   - Sample size reported
   - Effect size magnitude
   - Study design classification
   - Risk of bias assessment

**Benchmark**: AI should match human **precision** (avoiding false positives) and **recall** (avoiding false negatives)

---

### 3.3 Novel AI-Enabled Screening Stages

**Key Insight**: AI time is cheap → Add screening stages impossible for humans

#### Stage 3.5: Methodological Quality Pre-Filter (Abstract Level)

**Human Constraint**: Can't assess quality from abstract alone (need full-text)

**AI Capability**: Extract methodological signals from abstract

**Criteria**:
```python
quality_signals = {
    'sample_size_mentioned': bool,
    'control_group_indicated': bool,
    'outcome_measures_specified': bool,
    'statistical_analysis_mentioned': bool,
    'effect_size_reported_in_abstract': bool
}

# Score: 0-5 (count of True signals)
# Threshold: ≥3 to proceed to full-text
```

**Benefit**:
- Reduces full-text screening load by 40-60%
- Prioritizes high-quality studies
- Transparent criterion (replicable)

**Validation**:
- Correlate abstract quality score with full-text quality score
- Expected: r > 0.70

---

#### Stage 6.5: Thematic Pre-Coding (Before Human Synthesis)

**Human Constraint**: Manual thematic analysis of 100 papers takes weeks

**AI Capability**: Pre-code all papers, humans refine

**Process**:
1. AI reads all 100 included papers
2. AI proposes themes (e.g., "Personalized Learning", "Automated Feedback", "Intelligent Tutoring")
3. AI assigns papers to themes (one paper can have multiple themes)
4. Humans review AI coding:
   - Accept, modify, or reject themes
   - Re-assign papers if needed
5. Final thematic synthesis by humans using AI pre-coding

**Time Savings**: 4 weeks → 1 week

**Validation**:
- Calculate precision/recall of AI theme assignments vs. final human coding
- Goal: Precision ≥0.80, Recall ≥0.75

---

## 4. Comprehensive Validation Framework

### 4.1 Multi-Level Validation Strategy

#### Level 1: Internal Consistency (AI Self-Validation)
**Metrics**:
- Decision confidence distributions
- Inter-stage consistency rates
- Hallucination detection rates
- Sub-criteria score coherence

**Reporting**: Supplementary tables with full transparency

---

#### Level 2: External Validation (AI vs. Human Gold Standard)
**Design**:
```
Gold Standard Set: 200 papers (randomly sampled from full corpus)

Group A (n=100): Calibration
  - AI screens (blind)
  - 3 Humans screen (blind)
  - Calculate inter-rater reliability (AI vs. each human)
  - Benchmark: AI should achieve κ ≥ 0.75 (substantial agreement)

Group B (n=100): Validation
  - AI screens first
  - Disagreements flagged (AI vs. human predictions)
  - Adjudication by independent expert
  - Measure AI precision, recall, F1
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Cohen's κ (AI vs. Human) ≥ 0.75
- AI precision ≥ 0.85
- AI recall ≥ 0.80
- AI F1 ≥ human inter-rater F1

---

#### Level 3: Prospective Validation (External Replication)
**Process**:
1. Publish ScholarRAG systematic review + all materials
2. Invite external researchers to replicate using:
   - Same search strategy
   - Same inclusion criteria
   - Same AI prompts/config
3. Compare results:
   - Do they retrieve same papers?
   - Do AI decisions match?
   - Are conclusions similar?

**Goal**: Reproducibility rate ≥ 90% (same included papers)

---

### 4.2 Transparency & Reproducibility Standards

#### Open Science Framework (OSF) Pre-Registration

**Pre-Register Before Screening**:
```
Protocol Includes:
1. Research question (PICO framework)
2. Search strategy (exact queries for each database)
3. Inclusion/exclusion criteria (detailed)
4. AI configuration:
   - Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (version 20241022)
   - Temperature: 0.0 (deterministic)
   - Prompt templates (full text)
   - Screening stages (with thresholds)
5. Planned analyses
6. Data extraction form
7. Risk of bias assessment tool
```

**Timestamp**: Protocol is locked before any screening occurs

**Benefit**: Prevents p-hacking, post-hoc justifications

## 6. Anticipated Challenges & Mitigation

### Challenge 1: Journal Reviewer Skepticism

**Concern**: "AI cannot replace human expertise in systematic reviews"

**Mitigation**:
1. **Frame as Augmentation, Not Replacement**:
   - Emphasize: AI assists, humans decide
   - Report human adjudication rates (10-20% of decisions)
   - Highlight human-led synthesis

2. **Exceed Traditional Standards**:
   - AI inter-rater reliability > human baseline
   - More transparent than traditional reviews (full decision trail)
   - More reproducible (exact code/prompts shared)

3. **Pre-Empt Criticisms**:
   - Dedicated "Limitations" section
   - Acknowledge hallucination risks + mitigation
   - Compare favorably to human inconsistency

**Evidence**: Recent studies show Cohen's κ for humans = 0.50-0.82. If AI achieves κ = 0.84, it's competitive.

---

### Challenge 2: Reproducibility of LLM Outputs

**Concern**: "LLMs are stochastic, results may vary"

**Mitigation**:
1. **Deterministic Mode**: Temperature = 0.0
2. **Model Version Pinning**: Specify exact API version
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts reduce variability
4. **Ensemble Validation**: Run 3-5 times, report consistency

**Testing**: Replicate screening 3 times with same config
- Expected: 95%+ identical decisions
- Report: "Reproducibility analysis: 97.2% decisions identical across 3 runs"

---

### Challenge 3: Cost & Access Barriers

**Concern**: "Researchers in low-resource settings can't afford API costs"

**Mitigation**:
1. **Cost Transparency**: Report exact costs ($500-2,000 per review)
2. **Compare to Traditional**: Traditional review costs $140K+
3. **Institutional Support**: PSU Cloud Services model (free API access)
4. **Open-Source Alternative**: Support local models (Llama, Mixtral)
   - Trade-off: Lower cost but potentially lower quality

**Future**: Grant funding for "AI-Assisted Review as a Service" for underfunded researchers

---

### Challenge 4: Hallucination Risk

**Concern**: "LLMs may fabricate facts"

**Mitigation**:
1. **Citation-Grounded Extraction**: All facts must cite exact text
2. **Hallucination Detection**: Automated fact-checking pipeline
3. **Human Verification**: 10% sample manually verified
4. **Conservative Threshold**: When uncertain, flag for human review

**Reporting**: "Hallucination rate: 0% (0/1,247 data points)"

**Backup**: If hallucinations detected, exclude those data points and report transparently

---

### Challenge 5: Ethical Concerns (Bias Amplification)

**Concern**: "AI may amplify biases in literature"

**Mitigation**:
1. **Bias Audit**: Analyze AI decisions by study characteristics
   - Does AI favor US studies over international?
   - Does AI favor quantitative over qualitative?
   - Does AI favor positive results over null results?

2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Re-run with different prompts to test robustness

3. **Transparent Reporting**: Document any bias patterns observed

**Example Table**:
```
| Study Characteristic | Included | Excluded | Chi-square | p-value |
|----------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------|
| US vs. International | 60 vs 40 | 580 vs 320 | 0.42 | 0.52 |
| Quant vs. Qual       | 80 vs 20 | 700 vs 200 | 0.89 | 0.35 |
| Positive vs. Null    | 70 vs 30 | 650 vs 250 | 0.33 | 0.57 |
```

Interpretation: No significant bias detected (all p > 0.05)

- Personnel: 2 reviewers × 300 hours each = 600 hours
- Cost: 600 hours × $50/hour = $30,000
- Screening: 10,000 abstracts → 500 full-texts → 100 included
- Inter-rater reliability: Cohen's κ = 0.79

**AI-Assisted Review (ScholarRAG)**:
- Time: 3-6 weeks
- Personnel: 1 reviewer × 80 hours = 80 hours (AI handles bulk screening)
- Cost: 80 hours × $50/hour = $4,000 + API $500 = $4,500
- Screening: Same corpus, but AI reads ALL full-texts (800), 4 extra filtering stages
- Inter-rater reliability: Cohen's κ = 0.84 (AI vs. human)

**Savings**: 85% time, 85% cost, higher reliability
