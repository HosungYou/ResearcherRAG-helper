## How to Use These Examples

### Option 1: Study the Structure
Browse the example projects to understand what outputs each stage produces and how they connect.

### Option 2: Follow as Tutorial
Step through each stage folder in order, reading the markdown files to understand the decision-making process.

### Option 3: Use as Template
Copy an example project structure and modify it for your research domain:

```bash
# Copy example structure
cp -r examples/chatbot-language-learning ../my-research-project
cd ../my-research-project

# Update config.yaml with your research question
# Modify PRISMA criteria for your domain
# Run through stages 1-7
```

## FAQs

### Q: Can I use these examples for my own research?
**A**: Yes! All examples are provided under open licenses. You can copy, modify, and adapt them. Just cite ResearcherRAG if you publish.

### Q: Are these examples peer-reviewed?
**A**: These are demonstration projects. While they follow best practices (PRISMA 2020, systematic methods), they are not peer-reviewed systematic reviews themselves.

### Q: How do I know if an example matches my research needs?
**A**: Check the README of each example. Look for:
- Similar research domain
- Similar target paper count
- Similar methodology (quantitative vs qualitative vs mixed)
- Similar publication goals (thesis vs journal)

### Q: Can I request an example in my specific domain?
**A**: Yes! Open an issue with the `example-request` label and describe your research domain and use case. We'll prioritize popular requests.
