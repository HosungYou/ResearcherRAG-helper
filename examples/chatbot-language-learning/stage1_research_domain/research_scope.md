# Stage 1: Research Domain Setup
**Date**: 2024-10-15
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Researcher**: Example Researcher

## Research Question

> **"Do AI chatbots improve speaking proficiency in university-level language learners?"**

### Rationale
- **Population**: University students are more autonomous learners, distinct from K-12
- **Intervention**: AI chatbots specifically (not general language apps)
- **Outcome**: Speaking proficiency is the most challenging skill to practice alone
- **Context**: Rising interest in AI for education, but limited systematic reviews on speaking

---

## PICO Framework

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Population** | University-level language learners (ages 18+, any language) |
| **Intervention** | AI-powered chatbots / conversational agents |
| **Comparison** | Traditional instruction, human partners, control groups, or pre-post |
| **Outcome** | Speaking proficiency (fluency, accuracy, pronunciation, complexity) |

---

## Scope Constraints

### Included:
✅ University students (undergraduate, graduate)
✅ Any target language (English, Spanish, Chinese, etc.)
✅ AI chatbots with conversational capabilities
✅ Speaking as primary or secondary outcome
✅ Quantitative and qualitative studies
✅ Published 2015-2024 (modern NLP era)

### Excluded:
❌ K-12 students, children, adults outside university
❌ Non-chatbot technologies (VR, mobile apps without conversation, games)
❌ Studies without speaking outcome measures
❌ Review papers, opinion pieces, editorials
❌ Pre-2015 publications (pre-modern NLP)

## Feasibility Assessment

### Initial Scoping Search
Conducted quick searches to estimate paper count:

**Semantic Scholar**: ~180 potential papers
**OpenAlex**: ~150 potential papers
**arXiv**: ~25 potential papers
**Total estimate**: ~300-400 papers before deduplication

### Expected Final Dataset
After PRISMA screening:
- **Realistic range**: 50-80 papers
- **Rationale**: Specific population (university) + specific outcome (speaking) + recent technology (AI chatbots)

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Primary**: Determine whether AI chatbots are effective for improving speaking proficiency
2. **Secondary**: Identify which chatbot features are most effective
3. **Secondary**: Understand learner perceptions and engagement with chatbots
4. **Secondary**: Identify research gaps and future directions

---

## Target Outputs

### For Dissertation/Thesis:
- Systematic review chapter (30-40 pages)
- PRISMA flow diagram
- Synthesis table of all included studies
- Evidence-based recommendations

### For Journal Publication:
- Manuscript for CALL journal or Applied Linguistics journal
- Supplementary materials (search strategy, PRISMA checklist)

---

## Timeline

- **Stage 1-3** (Query + PRISMA setup): 1 week
- **Stage 4-5** (RAG build): 1 day
- **Stage 6** (Research queries): 2-3 weeks
- **Stage 7** (Documentation): 1 week
- **Total**: ~5-6 weeks (vs. 3-4 months manual review)

---

## Resources Needed

### Time:
- ~40 hours researcher time (vs. 150-200 hours manual)
- ~4 hours computational time (automated)

### Budget:
- API costs (embeddings + LLM): < $10
- No database subscription needed (using open access sources)

### Technical:
- Python 3.10+
- VS Code + Claude Code extension
- 5GB disk space (for PDFs + vector database)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Find 50-100 relevant papers (sufficient for comprehensive review)
✅ Achieve >90% inter-rater reliability in screening (AI + human)
✅ Complete review in <6 weeks (vs. 3-4 months manual)
✅ Generate publication-ready PRISMA diagram and methods section

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Research scope validated → Proceed to Stage 2 (Query Strategy)
2. Estimated paper count is realistic (300-400 → 50-80)
3. Databases selected: Semantic Scholar + OpenAlex + arXiv
4. Timeline approved by advisor

---

## Notes

- **Decision**: Focus on university-level only (not K-12) to maintain population homogeneity
- **Decision**: Include any target language (not just English learners) to increase coverage
- **Decision**: 2015 cutoff chosen because modern NLP (word embeddings, neural models) became prevalent
- **Consideration**: May need to manually contact authors for ~10-15 papers behind paywalls (not included in automation)

---

**Status**: ✅ Stage 1 Complete
**Next Stage**: Query Strategy Design (Stage 2)
**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes
