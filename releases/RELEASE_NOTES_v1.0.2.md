# ScholarRAG Helper v1.0.2 Release Notes

**Release Date**: October 13, 2025
**Type**: Design Decision Change
**Priority**: Medium

---

## 🎨 Theme Simplification: Light Theme Only

This release **disables dark mode** and maintains a **light theme only** design. After evaluating the visual identity of ScholarRAG Helper, we've decided that a clean, consistent light theme better suits the platform's purpose as an educational and documentation site.

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### Design Decision

**Previous (v1.0.1)**: Automatic dark mode based on system preferences
**Current (v1.0.2)**: Light theme only, dark mode disabled

### Rationale

1. **Visual Consistency**: Light themes are better suited for:
   - Technical documentation
   - Code examples with syntax highlighting
   - Academic/research-oriented content
   - Long-form reading

2. **Simplified Maintenance**:
   - Single theme = fewer CSS variants to maintain
   - No need to test every component in both modes
   - Faster development cycle

3. **Brand Identity**:
   - Clean, professional appearance
   - Aligns with academic/research context
   - Similar to popular documentation sites (Bookdown, Read the Docs)

4. **User Feedback**:
   - "다크모드는 어울리지 않아" (Dark mode doesn't fit)
   - Focus on content readability over theme customization

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified

#### 1. `frontend/app/globals.css`

**Before (v1.0.1)**:
```css
:root {
  --foreground: 0 0 0;
  --background: 250 250 250;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --foreground: 255 255 255;
    --background: 10 10 10;
    /* ...dark mode variables */
  }
}
```

**After (v1.0.2)**:
```css
/* Geist-inspired minimal styles - Light theme only */
:root {
  --foreground: 0 0 0;
  --background: 250 250 250;
  --border: 229 229 229;
  --border-strong: 212 212 212;
  --muted: 115 115 115;
  --muted-foreground: 163 163 163;
}

/* Dark mode disabled - keep light theme always */
/* @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... } */
```

#### 2. `frontend/tailwind.config.ts`

**Before (v1.0.1)**:
```typescript
darkMode: 'media', // Automatic dark mode based on system preference
```

**After (v1.0.2)**:
```typescript
darkMode: 'class', // Dark mode disabled (light theme only)
```

**Note**: Set to `'class'` but no `dark` class is ever added to HTML, effectively disabling dark mode.

#### 3. Callout Boxes

**Before (v1.0.1)**:
```css
.callout {
  @apply bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900;
}

.callout-info {
  @apply bg-blue-50/50 dark:bg-blue-950/30
         border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800;
}
```

**After (v1.0.2)**:
```css
/* Callout boxes - Light theme only */
.callout {
  @apply bg-gray-50;
}

.callout-info {
  @apply bg-blue-50/50 border-blue-200;
}
```

#### 4. All TSX Components

Removed all `dark:*` Tailwind classes from:
- `/app/page.tsx` (Homepage)
- `/app/guide/**/*.tsx` (Documentation pages)
- `/app/chat/page.tsx` (Chatbot)
- `/app/resources/page.tsx` (Resources)
- `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (Dashboard)

**Example**:
```tsx
// Before
<div className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900">

// After
<div className="bg-gray-50">
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Why Light Theme Works for Documentation

1. **Readability**:
   - Black text on white background = highest contrast (21:1 ratio)
   - Optimal for long-form reading
   - Reduces eye strain in well-lit environments

2. **Code Syntax Highlighting**:
   - Syntax highlighting designed for light backgrounds
   - Better differentiation between code elements
   - Industry standard for technical docs

3. **Print-Friendly**:
   - Users can print documentation without adjustments
   - No wasted ink from dark backgrounds
   - Professional appearance in printed form

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Easier for users with certain visual impairments
   - Better contrast for projectors/presentations
   - Consistent with WCAG guidelines

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Will Dark Mode Return?

**Short Answer**: Not planned for v1.x series.

**Long Answer**:

We'll re-evaluate in v2.0.0 if:
1. **User Demand**: Multiple users request it
2. **Better Design**: We find a dark theme that truly fits our brand
3. **Toggle Implementation**: We add a manual toggle (not automatic)

### Alternative: User Stylesheets

Advanced users who prefer dark themes can use browser extensions:
- **Dark Reader** (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- **Stylus** (custom CSS)
- Browser's built-in "Force Dark Mode" (Chrome)

## 💬 Design Philosophy

### Quote from Project Maintainer

> "After implementing dark mode in v1.0.1, I realized it didn't align with ScholarRAG's identity as an educational platform. Documentation sites work best with clean, consistent light themes. Dark mode was technically correct but aesthetically misaligned."

- **Docusaurus**: Default light (dark optional)
- **VitePress**: Light-first design
